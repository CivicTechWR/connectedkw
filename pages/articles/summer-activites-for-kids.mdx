## Mary Allen Park Playgroup
*Thursdays at 12:45*

The group meets at the park and walks together to the Rogers Street EarlyON, right across from the Cafe Pyrus Outpost. If you’d rather meet at the centre, the playgroup usually arrives to the EarlyON centre around 1pm. 

It’s the perfect way to meet other parents and caregivers during the day and get the kiddos engaging with some social play! 🌞🌈✨
