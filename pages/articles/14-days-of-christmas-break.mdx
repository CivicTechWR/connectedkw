# 14 days of Christmas break*

*Or whatever you celebrate this time of year! This is for any family that has young kids at home for two long weeks while school/daycare is off, and may be looking for things to do. We've listed one free or cheap activity for every day of the break. 

## Day 1. Still coming down from the sugar high
Monday, Dec 26

With a blanket of fresh snow, Huron Natural Area is sure to be a winter wonderland. Just picture walking through the silent snowy woods; a mental and physical reset after the excitement of Christmas. You might even want to borrow [snowshoes](https://www.kpl.org/things-to-check-out/cool-things) from the KPL!

## Day 2. Time to get the skates out
Tuesday, Dec 27

There's free community skating at Don McLaren arena today, from 4:00 PM to 4:50 PM. There are a ton of free skating sessions, so check the schedule to find one that works for you. The arena is right on the Ion line too, if you want to take the train. If you want more flexibility, you probably already know about the free outdoor rinks at Waterloo Public Square and Carl Zehr Square that are open all day. But did you also know that you can borrow skates from the [KPL](https://www.kpl.org/things-to-check-out/cool-things)?
