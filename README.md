## About

**Connected KW** is a volunteer-run project creating an inclusive and comprehensive resource for families in Waterloo Region. We help residents discover what's happening in their community through:

- **Events Calendar:** Local events across categories (art, nature, family-friendly)
- **Interactive Maps:** Public art, splashpads, playgrounds, neighborhood data
- **Community Resources:** Centralized information for residents

Stay connected by subscribing to our [events calendar](https://www.connectedkw.com/events) and following us on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/connectedkw).

## Get Involved

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js
- **Backend:** Directus CMS
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Development

This project is a collaboration between [Dreamside Digital](https://www.dreamsidedigital.com/) and Civic Tech WR. If you're interested in contributing, please introduce yourself at one of our [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/civictechwr/).

### Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Create an `.env.local` file and copy in the environment variables (from the pinned comment in the Slack channel) 

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### API Routes

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
